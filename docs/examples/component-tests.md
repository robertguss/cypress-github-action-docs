# Component tests

You can run [Cypress component tests](https://on.cypress.io/component-testing) in a job separate from E2E tests by adding `component: true`:

```yml
- name: Run E2E tests ðŸ§ª
  uses: cypress-io/github-action@v4

- name: Run Component tests ðŸ§ª
  uses: cypress-io/github-action@v4
  with:
    # we have already installed everything
    install: false
    # to run component tests we need to use "component: true"
    component: true
```

See [example-component-test-workflow](https://github.com/cypress-io/github-action/blob/master/.github/workflows/example-component-test.yml) for more details.
