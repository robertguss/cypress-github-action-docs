# Subfolders

Sometimes Cypress and end-to-end tests have their own `package.json` file in a subfolder, like

```text
root/
  e2e/
    (code for installing and running Cypress tests)
    package.json
    package-lock.json
    cypress.json
    cypress

  (code for running the "app" with "npm start")
  package.json
  yarn.lock
```

In that case you can combine this action with [bahmutov/npm-install](https://github.com/bahmutov/npm-install) action to install dependencies separately.

```yml
name: E2E
on: push
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-20.04
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@master
      - name: Install root dependencies
        uses: bahmutov/npm-install@v1

      - name: Start server in the background
        run: npm start &

      # Cypress has its own package.json in folder "e2e"
      - name: Install Cypress and run tests
        uses: cypress-io/github-action@v4
        with:
          working-directory: e2e
```
