# Migration guide

## v1 to v2

This is noted as a breaking change ... but you should not see any changes. We have changed how we run Cypress (from using the command line to using the [NPM module API](https://on.cypress.io/module-api)), which is a big change. But hopefully our examples are complete and we did not break anyone's code.
